# Compile7 Blog
Compile7 Blog is a place for developers to learn and contribute. We also call it *Decompile* for the simple reason that it helps developers learn and enables them to help others with their contributions.

At Compile7 Blog, anyone — irrespective of their experience and skills — can contribute: your contribution could be as simple as fixing a typo or writing a detailed blog on how to write efficient and secure code — no matter what, we accept contributions as long as they add positive value for everyone.
## How to Contribute?
- Refer to our CONTRIBUTION GUIDE for general contributions.

- Refer to our [GUIDELINES](./guidelines.md) for blog post writing and related contributions.

## Code of Conduct
Compile7 Blog is a safe, welcoming, and collaborative project for anyone to interact and contribute. We strongly discourage discrimination, intimidation, condescending, and demeaning of any sort towards anyone based on their gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, physical characteristics, special abilities, nationality, etc.

If you come across any instance or anyone breaching our code of conduct, report to us.
